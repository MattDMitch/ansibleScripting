# ansibleScripting
Script to run playbooks and parse log files
 This script runs an ansible playbook and prses the log files and sends an email to a specfied email address. 
 This is done through the use of an email relay. For security reasons the passwords and file paths have been removed.
 There is some minor adjustedment done on the network for this to work, the parsing is specfic to the format of my inventory file.
